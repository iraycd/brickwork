## Developers

### Installation for development
First we have to the requirements.
#### Requirements
+ **Node** - First thing you need to have is Node and NPM on you computer.
+ **Gulp** - Install Gulp `npm install gulp -g`
+ **`npm install`** to install the project requirements.

I have used `gulp-rigger` to organize the code. `src` is the directory where the entire code is written. `src/brickwork.js` is main file which is compiled as `brickwork.js` and `brickwork.min.js`

### Running the code
After the installation of the requirement you just need and when you have completed your changes you just need to follow.

+ Run `gulp rig` to make to compile the code to `brickwork.js`
+ Run `gulp uglify` to make both `brickwork.js` and `brickwork.min.js`
